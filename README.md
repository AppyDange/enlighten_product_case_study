# 🚀 Product Management Case Study: Enlighten

> **Role:** Product Manager | **Timeline:** Aug 2024 - Dec 2024  
> **Outcome:** Secured Seed Funding 🏆

---

## 📖 Executive Summary
**Enlighten** is an AI-driven educational platform designed to help international graduate students bridge academic knowledge gaps. 

As the Product Manager, I identified that international students (specifically in Finance) struggle with "assumed competencies" in the U.S. education system. I led the product strategy from user research to a successful pitch, securing seed funding to build "a Professor in your pocket."

## 1. Understanding the User
We moved beyond assumptions by interviewing 50+ students, leading to our primary persona: **"Mayur," a Finance Masters Student.**

### Customer Journey Map
We mapped Mayur's emotional journey as he transitioned from his undergraduate studies in India to a U.S. university. The map below highlights the "Gap of Anxiety" where existing solutions failed him.

**Key Insights from Research:**
* **The Trigger:** Mayur realizes he lacks foundational concepts that U.S. professors expect him to know ("Assumed Competencies").
* **The Struggle (Phase 3):** He wastes time juggling scattered resources (YouTube, Coursera, Textbooks), leading to frustration and burnout.
* **The Opportunity:** We identified the need for a **Personalized Onboarding** system that assesses gaps immediately and generates a tailored learning path.



## 2. Strategic Scope: The Ecosystem Bullseye
To define our MVP scope, we used a "Bullseye" mapping exercise. We placed the **International Master's Student** at the center and mapped their relationships to stakeholders and potential solutions.

**Strategic Mapping:**
* **Center (Primary User):** International Master's Student.
* **Direct Stakeholders:** Mentors & Professors (who create the "Accent Barrier" and "Assumed Competencies" problems).
* **Outer Ring (Solutions):** We brainstormed solutions for each friction point, selecting **AI Tutoring** and **One-Stop Platform** as our high-impact features to bridge the gap between students and professors.



## 3. The Pitch & Business Case
We synthesized our findings into a pitch deck, requesting **$3,000** for customer validation and early prototyping.

**The Solution Proposed:**
* **AI-Generated Adaptive Syllabus:** Instantly fills knowledge gaps based on the user's background.
* **Real-Time Transcription:** Solves the "Professor's Accent" pain point.
* **Smart Progress Tracking:** Moves the student from "Anxious" to "Confident."


## 🏆 4. The Result: Seed Funding Secured
The validation phase concluded with "Pitch Day," where we presented our business case to the Investment Committee.

### The Winning Moment
We successfully secured the funding cheque to move Enlighten into the next phase of development.

## 7. Key Learnings & Retrospective

> *"A Product Manager defines the 'Why' and 'What' so the team can build the 'How'."*

### 1. The Power of Niche Strategy
Initially, we considered targeting all international students. However, market analysis revealed that Engineering (66% of the market) was saturated with competitors like Chegg.
* **The Pivot:** We narrowed our focus to **Finance & Management students (22% of the market)**.
* **The Result:** We identified a "Blue Ocean" with fewer competitors and higher "pain" regarding specific U.S. financial concepts (e.g., GAAP vs. IFRS).

### 2. Solving for "Anxiety," Not Just "Grades"
Our Customer Journey Map revealed that the user's primary emotion was *anxiety* and *culture shock*, not just academic confusion.
* **Product Impact:** We shifted the value proposition from "Better Grades" to **"Academic Confidence."**
* **Feature Choice:** This led us to prioritize the **"Real-time Transcription"** feature to solve the immediate stress of understanding accents in lectures, rather than just generating static quizzes.

### 3. Balancing AI Costs in a Freemium Model
Building with GPT-3 and GPT-Neo offers power, but also high inference costs.
* **The Challenge:** How to offer a "Freemium" model without bankrupting the startup on API costs?
* **The Solution:** We scoped the MVP to cache common syllabus structures (Static Generation) and reserve expensive Real-Time AI queries (Dynamic Generation) for the Premium tier.
